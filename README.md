# Virtual Team Workspace on AWS

Welcome to the Virtual Team Workspace project! This repository contains the code and configuration files needed to deploy a scalable and secure virtual workspace environment using Amazon Web Services. This solution is designed to facilitate communication and collaboration for remote teams, integrating services like Amazon WorkSpaces, Amazon Chime, and Amazon WorkDocs.

# Project Overview

This project aims to create a fully functional virtual team workspace that supports various business needs including meetings, document management, and day-to-day operations in a secure cloud environment. It leverages AWS services to ensure high availability, security, and scalability.

# Architecture

The deployment includes:
- Amazon VPC configured with three public subnets and two private subnets across multiple Availability Zones.
- Amazon WorkSpaces for providing virtual desktops to users.
- Amazon Chime for team communication.
- Amazon WorkDocs for document storage and sharing.
- Amazon RDS for database services.
- Elastic Load Balancer (ELB) to distribute incoming network traffic.
- Internet Gateway (IGW) to allow communication between instances and the internet.
- NAT Gateway to enable internet access for instances in private subnets.
